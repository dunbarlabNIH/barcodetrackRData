For using the Siz et al sample data in the create_SE function or the barcodetrackR app, use the counts data file "WAS5_reads.txt" and the metadata file "WAS5_metadata.txt". Alternativel, one can use the estimated cell counts file "WAS5_estabundance.txt" for counts instead.

The publicly available raw data from the published manuscript is available at https://github.com/BushmanLab/HSC_diversity/blob/master/data/intSites.mergedSamples.collapsed.csv.gz

The script preprocessing.R reads in this raw data and outputs counts and metadata files in the format amenable to barcodetrackR.
