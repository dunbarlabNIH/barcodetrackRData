For using the Espinoza et al sample data in the create_SE function or the barcodetrackR app, use the counts data file "zl34_count_matrix.txt" and the metadata file "zl34_metadata.txt".

The raw data is available in the NIH GEO via the accession number GSE153130
We deposited the counts and metadata files in the format amenable to barcodetrackR directly into this folder for convenience.
