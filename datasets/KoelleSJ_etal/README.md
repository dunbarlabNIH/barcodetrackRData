For using the Koelle et al sample data in the create_SE function or the barcodetrackR app, use the counts data file "ZH33_reads.txt" and the metadata file "ZH33_metadata.txt".

The raw data is available for from https://github.com/dunbarlabNIH/R-code-and-tabular-data/tree/master/datacoderesults/data but the actual file is not included in the directory because it is too large.

The script "preprocessing.R" reads in the raw data and outputs counts and metadata files in the format amenable to barcodetrackR.
